## About Me
I am a Data Analyst with hands-on experience working on real-world data projects across user research, clustering analysis, keyword analysis, comparative analysis, network analysis, and machine learning.

I have worked across data analysis, user clustering, keyword research, comparative analysis, network analysis, machine learning, and dashboarding, both independently and as a team lead.

I worked as the **Data Analytics Team Lead** on the **StoryTime4Kids** product, where I led data-driven decision-making to understand users, markets, and growth opportunities.

## Featured Projects

### StoryTime4Kids – User Clustering & Market Research
StoryTime4Kids is a children-focused educational app, an AI-powered interactive storytelling app that turns passive screen time into active, intelligent play for children aged 1–12. This platform enables children to make choices that shape each story, thereby developing their creativity, confidence, curiosity, and problem-solving skills. The app serves as an early cognitive support tool, encouraging independent thinking and safe exploration, while replacing mindless entertainment with engaging learning experiences. 
I worked as part of the core analytics team, where I co-led the data analysis effort and owned several critical analytical components.
