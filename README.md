## About Me
I am a Data Analyst with hands-on experience delivering end-to-end data projects across user research, clustering and segmentation analysis, keyword and competitive analysis, network analysis, machine learning, and business intelligence reporting.
I have led and executed projects involving user behavior modeling, revenue analysis, predictive modeling, and dashboard development—transforming complex datasets into clear, strategic insights that support decision-making.
My experience spans independent analytical work and team leadership roles, where I have structured workflows, guided data strategy, and translated technical findings into actionable recommendations for stakeholders.
I worked as the **Data Analytics Team Lead** on the **StoryTime4Kids** product, where I led data-driven decision-making to understand users, markets, and growth opportunities.

## Projects

### StoryTime4Kids – User Clustering & Market Research
StoryTime4Kids is a children-focused educational app, an AI-powered interactive storytelling app that turns passive screen time into active, intelligent play for children aged 1–12. This platform enables children to make choices that shape each story, thereby developing their creativity, confidence, curiosity, and problem-solving skills. The app serves as an early cognitive support tool, encouraging independent thinking and safe exploration, while replacing mindless entertainment with engaging learning experiences. 
I worked as part of the core analytics team, where I co-led the data analysis effort and owned several critical analytical components.
**Role:** Data Analytics Team Lead  
- Built detailed user clusters (Homeschooling Parents, Educators, Caregivers)
- Analyzed user behavior, motivations, pain points, and spending habits
- Identified real online communities and outreach opportunities
- Supported product positioning and growth strategy
